Font Organization Guide
=======================

Font Naming Convention:
- Fonts are numbered from 0 to 8 based on weight
- 0 = Boldest/Heaviest weight
- 8 = Lightest/Thinnest weight

File Formats:
- Available in TTF and WOFF formats
- Located in the 'persian-fonts' subdirectory

Usage Examples:
- vaz0: Boldest font, suitable for headers and titles
- vaz8: Lightest font, ideal for footers and secondary text

This system provides a complete weight spectrum from extra-bold to extra-light for comprehensive typographic hierarchy.
